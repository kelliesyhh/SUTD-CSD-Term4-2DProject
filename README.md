## Tasks
### 50.001 Info Systems and Programming
You need to implement a SAT solver in this project. A SAT solver takes a CNF propositional formula and finds an assignment to its variables that makes the formula true. In this problem, you will implement a SAT solver. You should develop and test your SAT solver independently of the hardware verification problem; i.e., don't feed it formulas produced from hardware verification, but choose formula test cases appropriately.

### 50.002 Computation Structures
#### Part 1: 32-bit Adder Optimization Instructions
1. Design and debug your circuit as described below
2. Using the appropriate checkoff file, verify that your circuit operates correctly and
submit it to the on-line checkoff system.
3. Demo to your instructors.
The goal of this design project is to improve the performance of the 32-bit adder/subtractor unit built in [Lab 3](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/lab/lab3)
#### Part 2: Translating Gate Netlist to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
1. Select one output bit that helps you proof the optimized circuit is equivalent to the original circuit.
2. From the gate netlist, derive the Boolean expression in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
3. You may write your own software or use and existing ones to do the translation from gate netlist to CNF.

### 50.004 Algorithms
Design and implement in Java, C, C++, Python, etc, or pseudocode, an algorithm that solves the 2-SAT problem in polynomial time in the number of variables and clauses.
